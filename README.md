# RecyclerView Implementation

This project is a tutorial which goes through the basics of implementing a RecyclerView in Kotlin. Topics include building a layout, implementing an adapter, and populating the view with data. 

Files and implementation added by myself can be found in galacticon-starter. Files added include RecyclerAdapter.kt and recyclerview_item_row.xml. Implementation added to MainActivity.kt, activity_main.xml, and strings.xml
